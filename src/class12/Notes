OOP(Object oriented programming)
Just simple rules and guidelines
It is just a way of writing code.
we create classes that have attributes/properties/fields
and methods/behaviours

Why should we learn OOP?
  - it simplifies the software development and maintenance(adding new features, updates)
  - code duplication is reduced
  - it also helps us represent something from real life
  with the help of classes and objects.

Class:
  is a blueprint or a design from which actual real life
  objects are created. Computer uses a class to check what
  that class can do.
  Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in) Here Scanner is a class
  scan is an object of scanner class. With the help of object
  we can use the methods from a class we can also use
  properties from that class.
Objects are created from classes and we can use them to call
methods

NOTE: Inside the class sequence does not matter. You can define the methods
first or a properties first/
