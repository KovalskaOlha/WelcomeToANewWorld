Constructors - similar to a method that is executed when we create an object.

Why do we need it? constructor initializes the object

How to create a constructor?
1)ALWAYS has a name same as a class
2) NO RETURN TYPE

Type of the constructors:
non-argument
parametrized

   this keyword - is used to refer to the current object
   This can be used with variables and methods

   this. used with  instance variables

   In situations when local variable have same name as instance -> we use this. to
   differentiate and refer to the instance variable

   this can be used to refer to the instance method as well

  this() ===> we are calling CURRENT class constructor
