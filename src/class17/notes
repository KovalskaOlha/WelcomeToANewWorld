Access Modifiers:
Mechanism which can help us to control the accessibility of instance or static fields,methods, classes.
There are 4 access levels and 3 keyword access modifier.
1) private( more restricted)
2) default ( this one is NOT a keyword)
3) protected
4) public

Constructors:
Constructors help us create objects easily or initialize the instance fields of
a class in a better way.
  1)They are similar to methods but they don't have return types.
  2)They have same name as class name.
  3)We can use all the access modifiers with the constructors.
  4)static keyword is NOT allowed with constructors
