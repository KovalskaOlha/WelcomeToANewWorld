FileHandling:
  process of reading a and writing the data through java code.
  To read or write the data:
  1.first we need to know the path or location where we will be reading or writing that file.
  2.we need to navigate to that location or to bring the file into the memory so
  that java program can process the data from that file.
  Classes that helps Java to read the data :
        FileInputStream
  to write the data:
       FileOutputStream
  3.we need to know about a class that knows how to read and write the data from
  specific file. For example we use Properties class when we have to read the data
  from the .properties file. We use XSSFWorkbook to read and write the data from the excel files

Why do we learn about FileHandling?
  1)we will be storing data like username, passwords, URLs, type of browsers etc
  in configuration files
  2)when we need to perform data driven testing we will be storing and reading
  all the data from files like xlsx or csv files

How to read/write data from files
   1. get the path
   2. use FileInputStream


**************EXCEPTIONS*******************
********************************************

What are Exception?
  Exceptions are runtime issues(it dont give a syntax errors) that can stop normal flow of our prorgams
  and can abruptly terminate the program which is very bad and leads to bad user
  experience
1) Checked exception
2) Unchecked

ExceptionHandling:
   We stop the program from terminating abruptly and we try to mitigate the
   issue we provide a backup code and convert the error message to simple text


System.out.println("Line1");
        System.out.println("Line2");
        System.out.println("Line3");
        System.out.println("Line4");
        System.out.println("Line5");
        System.out.println("Line6");
        System.out.println(10/0);---------> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticExcep
        System.out.println("Line7");
        System.out.println("Line8");
        System.out.println("Line9");
        System.out.println("Line10");


         try{
                    System.out.println(10/0);=====>plan A
                }catch (Exception e){
                    System.out.println(e);=======>plan B
                }
