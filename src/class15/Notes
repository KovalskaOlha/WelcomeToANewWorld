Methods in Java:
it just a collection of java statements and blocks of code
like if else loops, println etc.

Why should we learn about methods:
1) allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the
logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them build method
one by one and later on combine them to build the complete
application.
2) methods allow us to reuse code.
3) methods allow us to be flexible.

How can we create Methods?
There are 2 types built-in and user defined.
                Built-in methods?
The methods which are designed by Java developers for example
 the println(), nextInt() methods in Scanner class length () present in String
 class they are all built-in methods.
             User Defined Methods:
  They methods that we write.
  Methods which return smth when we called and other which do not return smth when
  we called them.

  int add( int a, int b){
  return a+b;
  }
  int ===> return type of a method
  add====> name of the method
  (int a, int b)=====> parameters of the method or the input tp the method
  {   } ====>> body of the method

  Rules:
  return type and the value that we are returning from a method should match
  we can only assign methods to variables of same type
  =======================================================

  There are tree types of Variables with respect to their scope
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~Local variable:
      if the variable is created inside a block of code like
      methods, loops, if condition they are called local variables.
  !!!!!!!!!UPSIDE: local occupy the memory for the shortest period of time
      you should always try to write code with a help of local variables
  !!!!!!!!!DOWNSIDES: Local variable can not be accessed outside the block
  in which they are created. They have very limited scope
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Instance variables:
        All the variables which are created inside a class BUT outside of
        methods are called instance variables.
    !!!!UPSIDE: We can use them in all the instance methods of that class,their
    scope is larger than local variables
    !!!!!DOWNSIDE: they stay longer in the memory as compared to local variables
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Static variables:
      Always have the keyword STATIC and are outside the method
