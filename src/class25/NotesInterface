Abstraction allows us to simplify code by hiding implementation and
   only showing the functionality to the user.
In Java we can achieve this in two ways.
1) Abstract classes
2) Interface (60-70% same as an abstract class)

Interface:
   is very similar to a abstract class !!special after Java8!!
 We can have private methods,static methods,default methods,abstract method
   But we can't have instance fields in an interface.
   *No constructors
   *No object
   *No instance field

   When we should use interfaces?
   when objects are closely related to each other (IS-A relation) we should go with ABSTRACT CLASSES
   if we want to use abstraction.
   If obj are not related to each other than we should implement
   abstraction with the help of INTERFACES.

   By default interface is abstract and public.We don't need
   to use keywords exept( implements and interface)
