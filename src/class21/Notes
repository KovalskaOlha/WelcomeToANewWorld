Super keyword:
Is used to refer to a parent class members like fields methods and
constructors.
   When we should use Super or This keyword:
when ever same field or method exist inside the parent and child class.
we can use super keyword to explicitly refer to parent class variable
method or constructor.

NOTE:
By default java prefer local variables then instance variable
from the same class after that the instance variables or method
from the parent class.

METHOD OVERLOADING
Method overloading happens when the same name method exist in a class
with different parameters
We can overload in 3 different ways:
~~~~~ we can change the number of parameters
~~~~~ we can change the data type
~~~~~ we can change the sequence of the parameters

Why should we overload a method or constructor?
clean code and flexibility to the end user
