Iterator:
Iterator is an interface if you want to remove add
something or planing to do an operation which can
change the size at run time than we should use iterator
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~SETS

*HashSet:
  Upside:FAST
  does not allow the duplicate value, and don't retain insertion  order
  If we want to remove the duplicate HASH is very good option
*LinkedHashSet:
  DO retain the insertion the order!And ALSO remove the duplicates
  DOWNSIdE: slower than HashSet
*TreeSet:
  Remove duplicates and print in alphabetical order A,B,C... or 1,2,3...
  Keeps the data sorted
  DOWNSIdE: the slowest

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MAPS
    Allows to store info with labels
* HashMap<String,Integer>
    we specify the type of data that we are going to store
    if we want to add smth method is .put()
    We store 2 values( key and value)
*LinkedHashMap
   maintain the order
*TreeMap
   will sort the data according to the keys

Maps and Arrays is very important in testers life
