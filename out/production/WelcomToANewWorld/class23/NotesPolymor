  Polymosphism: allows us to perform some actions in different ways. There are 2 types of
  polymorphism:
  early binding or  compile time
   runtime and late binding


    When we achieve the poly with a help with overriding its call
dynemic polimorphism(runtime)

  When we achieve the poly with a help with overloading its call
static polimorphism(early binding or  compile time)

How it can help us write better code?????
~~~~~ allows us to write less code and call multiple methods
         *Syntax*
     1) for the static polymorphism we only need to overload method
     2) for the dynamic polymorphism we need to extend from a class we need to
     override the methods from the parent class that we want to us in polymorphism



Final keyword when used with a variable the Value will not be changed
when used with a method no one can override that method
when used with a class no class can inherit from it.
99% final keyword is used with a static keyword  That is how we make a constance
There are three main uses of the final keyword
1) we can't change the value of variable which is assign as final
when we have to create constants then we declare the variables as final
2) we can't override the method as it is declared as final
3) can be used with the classes as well. no other class can inherit this class
