Sets:
  Sets do not allow duplicate values. There are a lot of types
  Three main are:(another example of polymorphism)
  Same methods with different behaviors
  1)HashSet
        -speed is the faster of all
        -does not maintain the insertion order
  2)LinkedHashSet
         -maintains the insertion order
         -slower than HashSet
  3)TreeSet
        -sorted the data in an alphabetic order, or 1,2,3,4
        -its slower than all

Map:
  Instead of 1 value we can store 2 value(Key and value)
  Map is a data structure but has some attributes that
  make it special. Map is not a part of collection framework.
   1)HashMap
   2)LinkedHashMAp
   3)TreeMap
   the behavior exact same as the Sets
