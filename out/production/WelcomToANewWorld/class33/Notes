*******************EXCEPTIONS**********

  Exceptions is an unwanted behaviors which occurs at run time
and makes our programs terminate abruptly
Exception handling--> mechanism that helps us to avoid
 Exception Handling is a mechanism that allows us to avoid runtime errors
 and helps us convert  complex error messages to something simpler that
 a normal user can understand
   How we implement exception handling in java:
   we have new  keywords and new blocks of code which allow us to handle
   exceptions in Java
  Blocks: 1)try
          2)catch
          3)finally
  Key block: 4)throw
             5)throws

1)  TRY :
 in the try block we write the code which can throw an exception
2) CATCH :
 if something goes wrong in try block so java will execute catch block
 contains the backup code. it can also contain the code which might send
 a notification or an email to the developers or admins in case of failure
 We can have multiple catch blocks with one try block. We can also put a last catch block
 with Exception class so that if smth goes wrong and
 there is no specific catch block to handle it the Exception one will handle it

3) FINALLY :
 contains something that we always want to execute no matter what happens in the try block
 or the catch block (clean up code) f.e. to close the browser no matter if the test case has a problem
 problematic code we should put in try block , in catch block we put the back up code(exception), and in finally block
 we put close the browser to save the memory
 In finally block we should put cleanup code, like closing browser, closing database connection

4) THROW :
 we use when we are building our oun exception

 5) THROWS :
 put in header to put responsibility on java
