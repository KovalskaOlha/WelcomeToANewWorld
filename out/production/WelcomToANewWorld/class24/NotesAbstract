Abstraction:
   is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the functionality
   to user.
 Why we should use Abstraction?
   1) it reduces the code complexity
   2) it allows the end user to focus on using the features instead of
   worrying about the implementation
 Syntax:
   we need to declare the methods as abstract if we are not planning to provide
   the implementation. we also need to write the abstract keyword with the class
   as well.

   *** we can create everything in abstract class; variables,
   methods, constructions BUT we cants create it's OBJECT

   Abstraction allows us to simplify code by hiding implementation and
   only showing the functionality to the user.

   WE CAN HAVE Constructors for abstract class ( because child class might need to use it)
   this class will never use but CHILD may use
