If we have to read the data from file manually on our computer what do we need?
  1. we need to know where the file is stored in our computer(which folders)
  2. we need to navigate to that folder where a specific file is stored
  3. we need a software that can understand how the data is stored in those files
This is how we do it manually

To create a new directory and "properties" file:
1)Right click on your project name
2)new->directory(if you don't see a directory we can go with a package as well)->enter the name
3)Right click on your directory->new->File
4) give a name to your file and an extension as .properties(config.properties)

Why do we need .properties file:
 we use these files to store information like user name,password,URLs database connection
 so that information is secure and is not pushed with code on GitHub
