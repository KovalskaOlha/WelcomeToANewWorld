Array or ArrayList??
a lot of building methods are present in ArrayList
a lot flexibility
But performance and speed is more better in Array
If we are looking for speed so we should go with Array
Array occupies 4 times less memory than ArrayList
As a tester we dont care about the memory, nowadays memory is cheap


int=> primitive but the class is Integer
byte=>Byte
it's a convention classes always with Uppercase

boxing and unboxing in Wrapped classes
when we use a prim data type we box them inside the wrapper classes and used them with c
collection framework
in primitive to wrapper class >> boxing
when we get the data back from classes in primitive >> unboxing
