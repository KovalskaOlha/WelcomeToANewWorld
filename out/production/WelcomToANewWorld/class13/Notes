When we should use String Class:
 -- when we want to save as much memory as possible and we are
   ok if the programs get a little slow
When we should use StringBuilder Class:
   -- when we want maximum speed and we dont care how much memory
our program going to occupy

What does it mean by String is immutable:
  It means Strings are not changeable once created in the
  memory of computer, and the reason they are immutable
  is because same memory cell can be shared across many
  variables and if we allow any of the variable to change
  the value it can break the complete system.
